# Overview

# Does sender confidence influence bias?

## Raw judgments

## Signal detection

As a robustness check, I assessed whether confidence condition predicted the signal detection index "c" -- a measure of bias. As can be seen below, the results of this analysis support the results of the models examining raw judgments.

```{r}
summary(sdt_model_base)
```

Personally, I think the analyses of raw judgments are more informative (and more intuitve) than the signal detection analysis.
